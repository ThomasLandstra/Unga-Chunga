Unga Chunga will be an open source 2D platformer made using [PyGame](https://github.com/pygame/pygame) and will use my own package, [PySav](https://github.com/ThomasLandstra/PySav) (Currently Private). It will be initially made using the [PyGame Scrolling Shooter Game Beginner Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHgj5jhMJKg&list=PLjcN1EyupaQm20hlUE11y9y8EY2aXLpnv), made by [Coding With Russ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPrRY0S-VzekrJK7I7F4-Mg) and hopefully modified later.
